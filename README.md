# Pure Python Zstandard decoder

Pure Python Zstandard decoder. Largely based on [`fzstd`](https://github.com/101arrowz/fzstd).  

**Avoid using this in production.**  
Consider using [`zstandard`](https://pypi.org/project/zstandard/), [`zstd`](https://pypi.org/project/zstd/), or [`pyzstd`](https://pypi.org/project/pyzstd/), which has much better performance than this.
